! Fix parser, so it doesn't copy input during byte slice to string conversion


build set and get functions
        they need to be compatible with a possible overhaul of the underlying datastructure:
            I will start by using the built in map type to store the data
            use a cached conversion from []byte and string for my key and []byte for value
            In the future, I may implement my own hash table that natively supports type []byte as key 
        Find out if large array of bytes is a bad choice for map key type

Create TCP functionality, to allow for receiving and sending data

Create CLI functionality

find a way to send raw binary instead of characters

Nice to haves: GUI web interface for receiving and sending

what is ther error path
